  // You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

  // Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

  // Example 1:

  // Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
  // Output: 3
  // Example 2:

  // Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
  // Output: 0

  // Constraints:

  // 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
  // jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
  // All the characters of jewels are unique.

  //str -> jewels list str -> list stones (I have)
  //how many of my stones are actully jewels -> rock, emerald, rock, rock, emerald
