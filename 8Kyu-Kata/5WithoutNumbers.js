// 8 kyu 5 without numbers !!
// Write a function that always returns 5
// Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789*+-/
// Good luck :)
//P: None
//R: 5 but without using characters 0123456789*+-/
//E: No example just return 5!!!!
//Pseudocode: Use length property to return a 5
//My solution:
const unusualFive = () => [...'lmfao'].length;
