// //8Kyu Grasshopper - Debug sayHello
// Debugging sayHello function
// The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!
// Example output:
// Hello, Mr. Spock
//P: Given name/string
//R: Return "Hello, [name]"
//E: See above
//Pseudocode:
  //rewrite the code so that it takes in the name as an argument in the return string.
  //For example, implement a template literal string of `Hello, ${name}`
//My solution:
const sayHello = name => `Hello, ${name}`
