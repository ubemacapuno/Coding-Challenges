    The elves are working hard to clear paths filled with magical snow ❄️. This snow has a special property: if two identical and adjacent snow piles are found, they disappear automatically.

    Your task is to write a function to help the elves simulate this process. The path is represented by a string and each snow pile by a character.

    You need to remove all adjacent snow piles that are the same until no more moves are possible.

    The result should be the final path after removing all duplicate piles:

    removeSnow('zxxzoz') // -> "oz"
    // 1. Remove "xx", resulting in "zzoz"
    // 2. Remove "zz", resulting in "oz"

    removeSnow('abcdd') // -> "abc"
    // 1. Remove "dd", resulting in "abc"

    removeSnow('zzz') // -> "z"
    // 1. Remove "zz", resulting in "z"

    removeSnow('a') // -> "a"
    // No duplicate piles
   */
  function removeSnow(s) {
    let chars = s.split(""); // convert to array for methods

    for (let i = 0; i < chars.length - 1; i++) {
      if (chars[i] === chars[i + 1]) {
        chars.splice(i, 2);
        return removeSnow(chars.join("")); // recursive call
      }
    }

    return chars.join("");
  }
