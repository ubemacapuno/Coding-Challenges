  Filter Out the Geese!
  filter method
  Description:
  Write a function that takes an array of bird names and returns an array containing only birds that aren't geese. The geese you need to filter out are: "African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher".
  Example:

  filterBirds(["Mallard", "African", "Pigeon", "Toulouse", "Penguin"])
  Should return ["Mallard", "Pigeon", "Penguin"]

  filterBirds(["Steinbacher", "Duck", "African", "Chicken"])
  Should return ["Duck", "Chicken"]

  Double the Numbers
  map method
  Description: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and strings. 
  It should double any numbers but leave strings unchanged.
  Example:
  doubleNumbers([1, "apple", 3, "banana", 2]) 
  Should return [2, "apple", 6, "banana", 4]
  Parameters: array of numbers and strings
  Return: same array but with the numbers doubled
  Pseudocode: map through the array and check if the element is a number - if so double it. Return the array.

  Cart Total
  reduce method
  Description: Calculate the total cost of items in a shopping cart,
  applying a discount for items over $100.
  Items over $100 get a 10% discount.
  Example:
  cartTotal([{item: "book", price: 30}, {item: "phone", price: 120}])

  Find VIP Customer
  find method
